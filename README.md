"# Zoowsome" 
This project is a software simulation of Clujâ€™s future zoo, designed to highlight key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The system models various animal species, their behaviors, and interactions within the zoo environment, ensuring a structured and maintainable codebase.
